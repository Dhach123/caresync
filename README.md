💡 CareSync
A backend system powered by FastAPI, aiming to support AI-enabled health data processing.

✅ Setup Steps
🧪 Step 1: Create and Activate Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv health                 # Create virtual environment
health\Scripts\activate               # Activate (for Windows)
💡 Use source health/bin/activate on macOS/Linux.

🧱 Step 2: Create Project Structure
Created a template.py script to automatically generate the backend folder structure with necessary files and Python logging configuration.

Run this file to scaffold your backend environment.

bash
Copy
Edit
python template.py
📂 The script generates folders like backend/, and files like app.py, models.py, etc.
📄 Check template.py for customization or logging setup.

📦 Step 3: Install Required Packages
Install dependencies listed in requirements.txt:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt


🚀 Step 4: Start the FastAPI Server
Run the FastAPI application using uvicorn:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn app:app --reload

🧠 Step 5: Add AI Model Logic (ai_model.py)
Created a file named ai_model.py inside the backend/ directory.

This file contains logic for loading and interacting with the AI/ML model (can be LLM, text classification, etc.).

The function(s) in this file will be imported and used in app.py for inference via API routes.
